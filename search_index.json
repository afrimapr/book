It is aimed at those with a little knowledge of R. 1.1 Spatial data outline We will start by looking at these spatial data for Africa, shown in the map below. Capital city locations (points) A highway network (lines) Country boundaries (polygons) Population density (gridded or raster data) Cities, highways and boundaries are examples of point, line and polygon data termed vector data. The gridded population density data are termed raster data. In R there is often more than one package that does the same thing. Which one is ‘best’ for you may depend on preference and can change over time. This is true for R spatial operations. In R the sf package deals with vector data (points, lines and polygons), and the raster package deals with raster data. There are other packages too but we don’t need those for now.
