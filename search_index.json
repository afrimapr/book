It is aimed at those with a little knowledge of R. 1.1 Spatial data outline We will start by looking at these spatial data for Africa, shown in the map below. Capital city locations (points) A highway network (lines) Country boundaries (polygons) Population density (gridded or raster data) Cities, highways and boundaries are examples of point, line and polygon data termed vector data. The gridded population density data are termed raster data. In R there is often more than one package that does the same thing. Which one is ‘best’ for you may depend on preference and can change over time. This is true for R spatial operations. In R the sf package deals with vector data (points, lines and polygons), and the raster package deals with raster data. There are other packages too but we don’t need those for now.

A working directory is a folder where all your files associated with the project will be stored. For example, original datasets, saved datasets as well as plots, graphs or maps created and exported from R. Hence, working directory not only allows you to gather and access the files produced along the work but also load the existing datasets into the RStudio. You can set up the working directory with the openProject function as follows (recommended): rstudioapi::openProject(&quot;path to your directory&quot;) Alternatively, you can use the following command: setwd(&quot;path to your directory&quot;) While the former option will set up and open the working directory for your project, the latter simply determines the default folder for each specific R script. 3.2 Creating, naming and saving a new R script The R script is a plain text file that allows you to save the R code containing both, commands and comments. Saving the R script allows you to reuse your R code and creates a reproducible record of your work. Therefore, it is a good practice to create, name and save it at the very beginning of your project. You can crate a new R script by clicking the New File icon in the top right corner of the RStudio toolbar, which will open a list with different file options. Choose the R Script from the menu and the blank script will open in the main RStudio window. div.yellow { background-color:#fff5e6; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Shortcut: New R script can also be opened by Shift+Ctrl+N. You can now save your R script by clicking on the Save icon at the top of the Script Editor, this will prompt a Save File window where you can change the name of your script. Note that the file extension for R scripts is .R. At this point you can also choose a folder where to save your new file. By default, RStudio will try to save your new script in the current working directory. Once the name and file location are chosen, simply click the Save button. div.yellow { background-color:#fff5e6; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Shortcut: As you work along your R script document, you can quickly save changes by pressing Ctrl+S. 3.3 Executing the code Now, as you set up the working directory for your project and created your first R script file, we will look into ways of executing (also known as running) the code. You can execute selected chunk of code by clicking Run button at the top right corner of the Script Editor. div.yellow { background-color:#fff5e6; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;} Shortcut: You can also execute the selected code with Ctrl+Enter. If you do not select any code and press Run, RStudio will run the line of code where the cursor is located. The code which has been exectued will appear in the Console, usually located at the bottom part of the window. In RStudio it is also possible to add comments next to your commands simply using a hashtag (#) beforehand. This will stop R from executing this specific part: 3+6 #Using R as a calculator ## [1] 9 #3+6 3.4 Install &amp; load packages 3.5 Formats of spatial data (content, extensions) 3.6 Objects &amp; dataframes 3.7 Load data 3.8 Saving dataset 3.9 Saving &amp; exporting maps to the file "],["data-types.html", "Chapter 4 Spatial data types focusing on real examples: cities, roads, admin boundaries, surfaces", " Chapter 4 Spatial data types focusing on real examples: cities, roads, admin boundaries, surfaces Capital city locations (points) A highway network (lines) Country boundaries (polygons) Population density (gridded or raster data) "],["visualising-1.html", "Chapter 5 Visualising spatial data part 1: sf, mapview, tmap 5.1 Static maps 5.2 Layers for the static maps 5.3 Interactive maps 5.4 Layers for the interactive maps", " Chapter 5 Visualising spatial data part 1: sf, mapview, tmap In this section we use tmap, sf and mapview packages to visualise spatial data.
